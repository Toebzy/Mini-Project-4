# Mini-Project-4

### - Which machine learning methods did you choose to apply in the application?
For classification we chose to use a decision tree, and a Naice Bayes. We found one to have a higher accuracy, with a difference of 22%\
For Clustering we used a K-Means model.\
We got the best results using the Decision Tree learning method. 

### - How accurate is your solution of prediction?

#### Decision Tree:
Overall Accuracy: 0.826530612244898\
Accuracy for 0: 84.70%\
Accuracy for 1: 38.46%

#### Naive Bayes: 
Accuracy score:  0.6020408163265306\
Precision score:  0.20512820512820512\
Recall score:  0.5\
F1 score:  0.2909090909090909

Difference of accuracy = 0.2244897959

### K-Means:
Silhouette Score: 0.564

### - Which are the most decisive factors for quitting a job?
Attrition, Age, OverTime, JobLevel, MaritalStatus,	MonthlyIncome,	StockOptionLevel,	TotalWorkingYears,	YearsAtCompany,	YearsInCurrentRole,	YearsWithCurrManager
These are the factors we have found to be most decisive

### - Which work positions and departments are in higher risk of losing employees?
Sales seems to have the highest attrition when you consider the amount of employes

### - Are employees of different gender paid equally in all departments?
Our data shows that females on average earn more than me do. 
Sales has a even distrubution, while the other deparments lean towards a higher female pay

### - Do the family status and the distance from work influence the work-life balance?
According to correlation, there does not seem to be an influence between the two, as our correlation is 0,02

### - Does education make people happy (satisfied from the work)?
We took the average job satisfaction for education levels, and they seems somewhat equal, with no significant outlier. 

### - Which were the challenges in the project development?
We had an error with clustering that took a while to fix. It was also difficult to figure streamlit out.
